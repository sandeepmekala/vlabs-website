Match the following with their corresponding units : {=Resistance -> Ohm =Current  -> Ampere =Potential Difference -> Volt =Charge  -> Coulomb }

A potential difference of 10V appears across the ends of a resistor when 5A of current flows through it. The resistance of the resistor is ___ Ohm: {#2}

The graph of current I (on y-axis) Vs. potential difference V (on x-axis) is found to be a straight line. The slope of the straight line gives : {~Resistance ~Voltage =Reciprocal of resistance ~Current ~Charge}

Ammeter is always connected in series. {T}

Voltmeter is always connected in series. {F}

Which of the following will cause the current through an electrical circuit to decrease?{
~ %50% decrease the voltage
~ decrease the resistance
~ increase the voltage
~ %50% increase the resistance
}

An electrical device with a resistance of 3.0 Î© will allow a current of 4.0 amps to flow through it if a voltage drop of {#12} Volts is impressed across the device.
