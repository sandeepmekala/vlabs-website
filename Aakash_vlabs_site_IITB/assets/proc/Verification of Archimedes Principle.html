<h1>Materials Required:&nbsp;</h1> <p><strong>&nbsp;<img alt="" src="http://amrita.olabs.co.in/userfiles/1/image/Archimedes principleEquipments.png" height="342" width="800"></strong></p> <h1>The Procedure:&nbsp;</h1> <h2>As  done in a real lab<strong>:</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></h2> <p><strong><em>We&rsquo;ll first prepare  the strong salty water</em></strong><strong>:</strong></p> <p>Take 400 ml of tap water in a 500 ml beaker, add  some common salt to  it and stir well. Go on adding salt to the water and  dissolve it by  stirring the solution with a glass rod until some of the salt  remains  undissolved in the beaker. Decant the strong (saturated) salty water   and store for further use.</p> <p><strong><em>Now to start:</em></strong></p> <ul type="1"><li>Hang a spring balance on an iron stand using a  clamp.</li><li>Note the least count of the spring balance.</li><li>Take one of the solid blocks (S<sub>1</sub>) and weigh it by hanging it on  the hook of the spring balance using a thread. Find the weight of the solid  in air (W<sub>a</sub>) and note it.</li><li>Take two beakers (each of 250 ml) and mark them as  A and B.  Weigh them on a balance separately and note down the mass of beaker  A  and B.</li><li>Take an overflow can and fill it with water to the brim of the  outlet  and place beaker A below the overflow outlet of the can to  collect the displaced  water. Now, start lowering the metallic block (S<sub>1</sub>), still attached to  the spring balance into the water of the overflow can.</li><li>Note the loss of weight of the metallic block as it  gets  completely immersed in the water. Weigh beaker A which contains the   displaced water and note the mass. To find the mass of the water  displaced, subtract the initial mass of  beaker A (without displaced  water) from the present mass of the beaker A (containing  displaced  water).<br>     <img alt="(Weight of beaker A   Displaced water) - Weight of the empty beaker A = Weight of water displaced by completely immersing block (S1)" style="width: 876px; height: 26px;" src="http://amrita.olabs.co.in/userfiles/1/image/ArchimedesPrincipleProcedureEqn1.gif"></li><li>Repeat the experiment using the metallic block S<sub>1</sub>  by completely immersing it in the strong salty water in the overflow can. Note  the loss in weight S<sub>1</sub> by immersing it in the strong salt solution. Find the  mass of the salt solution displaced and collected in the beaker.<br>     <img alt="Weight of beaker B along with displaced salt solution - Wt. of the empty beaker B =  Wt. of displaced salt solution " src="http://amrita.olabs.co.in/userfiles/1/image/ArchimedesPrincipleProcedureEqn2.gif" height="22" width="859"></li></ul> <h2>As done using the simulator<strong>:</strong></h2> <ul type="1"><li>From the combo box, Select Environment, select the place where the experiment to be carried out.</li><li>Note down the least count of the spring balance.</li><li>The experimental blocks (Iron and Copper) are provided in the  simulator window. It can be attached to the spring balance by double  clicking on it.</li><li>The simulation can be performed in three media: air, tap water  or salty water.&nbsp; To do  this, choose any one of the above media from the  drop down box under &lsquo;Loss of weight&rsquo;.</li><li>You can now  find the weight of the block by moving the mouse  over the scale of the spring  balance.&nbsp; This shows a zoomed in area of   the scale that aids in taking the reading easily.</li><li>You can choose the medium as tap water or salty water&nbsp; for immersing the object.</li><li>From the digital balance, note the mass of the empty beaker.</li><li>Again as before, select the object of your choice and find  the weight after immersing the block in solution.</li><li>Now, the liquid overflows. Note down the new mass displayed in the digital balance.</li><li>The &lsquo;Reset&rsquo; button can be used to reset the  experiment to its initial state.</li></ul> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h1>Observations:</h1> <ul><li>Weight of metallic block S<sub>1</sub> in air =  .................. g wt.</li><li>Mass of empty beaker = ............ g.</li><li>Weight of the block (S<sub>1</sub>) after&nbsp;  immersed in solution = ................. g wt.</li><li>New mass displayed in the digital balance = ................. g.</li><li>Loss of weight of block in air = .............. g wt.</li><li>Mass of water displaced (m) = ...................... g.</li><li>Weight of solution displaced = m x g = ............ g wt.&nbsp;</li></ul> <h3>Least count of the spring balance :</h3> <p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5 divisions = 25 g.wt</p> <p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1 division = 25/5</p> <p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; =5 g.wt</p> <h1>Precautions:</h1> <div><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The string used to hang the spring balance should have negligible weight.</div> <div><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The metallic block should be gradually immersed in water.</div> <div><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Reading of spring balance should be taken only when it is stable.</div> <div><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>When immersing the metallic block in water, care should be taken that displaced water does not spill.</div>
